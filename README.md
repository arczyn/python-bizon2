Snippet of code for my own tool to keyword analysis.

This is a simple tool to add, remove and edit keywords list. It is an add-on to another, bigger keyword analysis tool that I have created (sorry, but I cannot show the whole source code here because of copyright reasons).

This particular code snippet uses Tkinter GUI to manage the keywords we want to analyse. We can add them one by one or load a bulk pack of keywords from TXT file. The result is a Python list with our keywords. The list is used for further text analysis in the full version of my tool.
Yes, I know this version has no scrollbar :)
